# Rainfall in Canada

Rainfall levels in Canada vary according to the region. The visualization shows monthly precipitation in several Canadian cities.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and combines React and D3 to implement the bar chart. React renders the visualization components, whereas D3 handles data and axis calculations, and axis transitions.

## Getting started
